    <ol>
    <li>Make the dough:In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
        Crack the egg into the bowl and add a little warm water.
        Gradually add more warm water, mixing until the dough begins to form.
        Add the oil or melted butter, then knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes on a floured sur- face, until smooth and elastic.
        Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.
        </li>
     <li>Prepare ththe fifilllling:
        Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft (around 15 minutes). Drain and mash them until smooth.
        In a pan, sauté the chopped onion in butter until golden brown (5-7 minutes).
        In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, cheese, sautéed onions, and season with salt and pepper. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
     <li>Form ththe pierogi:
        Roll the dough out on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick.
        Using a round cutter (a glass works well), cut out 3-inch circles from the dough.
        Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle.
        Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges together firmly to seal the pierogi, using a fork to crimp the edges if desired.</li> 
     <li>Cook ththe pierogi:
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
        Drop the pierogi into the boiling water in small batches. Do not overcrowd the pot.
        Once the pierogi float to the surface, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to ensure they are fully cooked.
        Remove the pierogi with a slotted spoon and set them aside.</li>
        <li>Serve:
            For a golden, crispy finish, heat some butter in a pan over medium heat and sauté the cooked pierogi for 2-3 minutes on each side until crispy.
            Serve the pierogi warm, topped with more melted butter, fried onions, or sour cream, as desired.</li>
