    <p>My name is Wiktoria popek. I come from Poland but I was born in New York on August 19,
    2001. I have been living in New York for 3 years in the Ridgewood district which I love.
    I came here with my husband and we both study and work. 
    I love traveling and creative activities that is why my major is Multimedia Programming and Design.
    I hope that someday I will find a job where I will be able to fulfill myself in this.</p>
